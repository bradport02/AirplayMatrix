# airplay-tv-power.sh — HDMI-CEC power control driven by shairport-sync
# session-state hooks (see /etc/shairport-sync.conf, sessioncontrol block):
#   run_this_before_entering_active_state -> "airplay-tv-power.sh on"
#   run_this_after_exiting_active_state   -> "airplay-tv-power.sh off"
#
# "entering active state" fires when an AirPlay device connects/starts a
# session. "exiting active state" fires sessioncontrol.active_state_timeout
# seconds (set to 300 = 5 min in the conf) after playback stops, so the
# 5-minute idle timeout before power-off is handled natively by
# shairport-sync -- no timer/debounce logic needed here.

# The TV's HDMI-input label (what many TVs show instead of "HDMI 1", the
# same way a Chromecast/Apple TV/games console's name usually appears there)
# is CEC's <Set OSD Name>, configured at logical-address-claim time via
# cec-ctl's --osd-name -- the kernel's CEC framework then answers any
# <Give OSD Name> query on our behalf for as long as the address stays
# claimed, no persistent listener process needed (confirmed live: other
# real devices already on the bus, e.g. an AV receiver and a games console,
# show up the same way via `cec-ctl -d /dev/cec0 -S`).
#
# Sourced fresh from shairport-sync.conf on every claim rather than cached,
# so renaming the device from the web UI takes effect on the next session
# without needing a separate hook there. <Set OSD Name>'s payload is a hard
# 14-byte protocol limit (see the HDMI-CEC spec) -- longer names get
# silently truncated by cec-ctl itself, so this truncates deterministically
# first instead: pick a name in the web UI you're fine seeing cut to its
# first 14 characters.
